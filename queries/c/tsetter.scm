;; ===================
;; Action Queries
;; ===================
;; --------------
;; Variables
;; --------------
;; For known declarations and initialisations
;; Example:
;;      char var_name
;;      int var_name = 10

;; Somehow `long` can't be seen as a declaration first, only if the semicolon is
;; added, so we have to use the query below for these cases.
(declaration
    type: (_)
    declarator: (_) @semicolon
)

;; Query for "special" variable declaration like the `long` type as descriped
;; above.
;; Example:
;;      long var_name
((sized_type_specifier
    type: (_)
) @semicolon)

;; Query for assignments.
;; Example:
;;      var = 10
((assignment_expression
    left: (identifier)
    right: (_)
) @semicolon)

;; --------------
;; Functions
;; --------------
;; This query is mainly used for custom function-calls
;; Example:
;;      my_func()
;; This query might look weird for a function call but the query looks like
;; this if we just write 'function_call()'. Don't believe me? Try it out by
;; adding this for example in a C file:
;;      
;;      int main() {
;;          function_call()
;;      }
;;
;; and open the TreeSitterPlayground afterwards ;)
((ERROR
    (call_expression
        function: (identifier)
        arguments: (argument_list)
    )
) @semicolon)

;; This is used for known functions like
;;      printf("welp")
;; Somehow the query above doesn't hit for `printf` for example, that's why we
;; need this query as well.
((expression_statement
    (call_expression
        function: (identifier)
        arguments: (argument_list)
    )
) @semicolon)

;; ----------------
;; Switch-Case
;; ----------------
;; Query for case statements like
;;      case 1
((case_statement
    value: (_)
) @double_points)

;; -----------
;; Macros
;; -----------
;; Places a semicolon after a macro call like "free()"
((macro_type_specifier
    name: (_)
    type: (_)
) @semicolon)

;; ----------------------
;; Other expressions
;; ----------------------
;; Small updates, for example like
;;      integer--
;;  or  integer++
((update_expression
    argument: (_)
) @semicolon)

;; Query for break statements
;; Tressitter sees a line with "break" only if there's already a semicolon!
;; Otherwise it'll display it as "ERROR" so we need to compare it on our own if
;; it's a break statement.
(ERROR "break" @semicolon)

;; Well... just return statements... like
;;      return 0
((return_statement
    (_)
) @semicolon)

;; ==========
;; Skips
;; ==========
;; If we are in a condition, than musn't add a semicolon in it! For example
;;      if (test()
;; So here are all "exception" cases. We have the query `ERROR` here, because if
;; we have a condition like
;;      if (...
;; Then we're having `ERROR` instead of `if_statement` since treesitter can't
;; detect it as an if-statement.
(ERROR ["if" "while" "for"] "(" @skip)
